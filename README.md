# Problem_Solving
Collections of coding problems solved apart from the usual in Algorithms repo

### Problem 1: Rearrange positive and Negative numbers at alternate poistions in an array in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
Program 1: Does not retain the order of the elements in the array 
Program 2: Retains the order of the elements in the array 

### Problem 2: This problem deals with variations of the matrix rotation problems 
Program 1: "clockwiseMethod1"
In this program, we rotate the matrix by 90 degrees in clockwise direction using an inplace method.
